;Commerce Kickstart is an installation profile designed to get up and running
;quickly with Drupal Commerce. It duplicates a standard Drupal installation and
;provides additional configuration for Commerce modules and components. While we
;intend for this installation profile to be the entrance point for many new users
;to Drupal Commerce, we will also be maintaining drush make files and eventual
;Features integration to make it a starting point for advanced Drupal users to
;quickly build out new e-commerce sites.

; Use this file to build a full distribution including Drupal core and the
; Commerce File install profile using the following command:
;
; drush make README <target directory>

api = 2
core = 7.x

projects[drupal][type] = core
projects[drupal][version] = "7"

; Add Commerce File to the full distribution build.
projects[commerce_file][type] = profile
projects[commerce_file][version] = 1.x-dev
projects[commerce_file][download][type] = git
projects[commerce_file][download][url] = git://github.com/EclipseGc/Commerce-File.git
projects[commerce_file][download][branch] = 7.x-1.x
